## Purpose

ðŸ”¶ Executing your GitHub action **locally** (or at any other environment).

ðŸ”¶ Writing integration and functional tests, run them locally and at CI.

ðŸ”¶ Having a short feedback loop without pushing and checking it behaviour at
real GitHub runners every time.

## Features

âœ… Supports executing JavaScript and Docker actions.

âœ… Tested under Windows, Linux and macOS locally and on GitHub hosted runners.

âœ… Works well with Docker Desktop under Windows and macOS (for Docker actions).

âœ… Can be used with any JavaScript test frameworks or alone.

âœ… Can execute an explicitly specified js file or _main_, _pre_, _post_ script from `action.yml`.

âœ… If you need to mock dependencies in a JS action, it can execute and test a separate sync or async JS function,
isolating its environment (process env, exitCode and working dir), intercepting _stdout_ and _stderr_ output.

âœ… Has a clear JavaScript API with TypeScript declarations and reasonable defaults

âœ… Provides a uniform way of setting action run options which can be reused for different targets
