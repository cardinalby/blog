&lt;p>I have always loved teas and drank them in exorbitant quantities, but I went deeper into the topic of Chinese teas since 2015.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One of the my favorite tea sort is shu and shen pu-erh; traditionally they are made in the form of pressed cakes. Very often they are wrapped in a paper wrapper with a beautiful art made for particular tea by order of a store or supplier. I always felt sorry to throw out these wrappers, so I came up with the idea to cut fragments out of them and present the fragments in the form of a collage.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
